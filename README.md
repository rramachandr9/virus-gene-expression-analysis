# Analysis of time series intensity profiles
We use dimensionality reduction, clustering, and sequence analysis techniques to quantify and compare the cell-to-cell dynamics of viral gene expression in primary and secondary infections of individual cells.
### Data
Contains experimental data, and toy datasets S1, S1-10, S1-20, S1-30, S1-40, S2, and S3. **Experimental data** are time series intensity profiles from HeLa cells infected by a human rhinovirus (A16) engineered to express enhanced GFP (eGFP) as a reporter of infection during plaque growth. **Toy datasets** are used to study the efficacy of the analysis techniques to distinguish between various sources of cell-to-cell heterogeneity.
### Code
Contains Python codes for data analysis and visualization.
